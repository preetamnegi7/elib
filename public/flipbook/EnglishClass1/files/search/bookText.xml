                 The National Curriculum Framework, 2005, recommends that children’s life at
                 school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a
                 departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our
                 system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The
                 syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to
                 implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and
                 the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope
                 these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-
                 centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education
                 (1986).
                       The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and
                 teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to
                 pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that given
                 space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with
                 the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook
                 as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources
                 and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible
                 if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a
                 fixed body of knowledge.
                       These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of
                 functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in
                 implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching
                 days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and
                 evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making
                 children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or
                 boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular
                 burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with
                 greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching.
                 The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and
                 space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small
                 groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.
                       NCERT appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development
                 committee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the
                 advisory group at primary level, Professor Anita Rampal and the Chief Advisor
                 for this book, Professor R. Lalitha Eapen (CIEFL, Hyderabad) for guiding the
                 work of this committee. Several teachers contributed to the development of this
                 textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making this possible. We are
                 indebted to the institutions and organisations which have generously

                 especially grateful to the members of the National Monitoring Committee,
